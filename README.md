- Creating the Project: Begin by setting up a new Express project.

- Adding a Sample GET API: Implement a GET API that returns a list of static details from a JSON file. This will involve creating a route in Express to handle the GET request and reading data from a JSON file to send back as a response.

- Adding a Sample POST API: Develop a POST API that returns a specific response and adds data to a JSON file. Similar to the GET API, this will require setting up a route in Express to handle POST requests, processing the incoming data, and updating the JSON file accordingly.

- Creating a Postman Collection: As an extra step, I will create a Postman collection that includes both the GET and POST APIs. This collection will serve as a handy tool for testing and documenting the functionality of the APIs.

- Extra: Adding Validation (If Possible): If time permits, I'll add validation to the APIs to ensure that incoming data meets certain criteria before processing it. This step enhances the robustness and security of the APIs.
